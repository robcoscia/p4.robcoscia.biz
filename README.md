For my fourth project, I developed a web site for a yoga studio. The main feature is to create a schedule dynamicly from information inputed through the add class form. The information is stored in a table called classes.

There is a notion of an admin user who has the privledges to add teachers and classes.  The user with email of admin@gmail.com and a password of P@ssw0rd is set up to be an admin.

I used javascript to validate the input of the signup form.  There is a tool tip, which doesn't work well that will tell you the password rules.
